# Groundwater-Level-Regression-Analysis
Ground Water Level is an important indicator of the quality of the environment; it indicates the availability of  water, prevalence of droughts and quality of water.

Thus ground water level is a good proxy for quality of the environment and can be used to model the 
relationship between the level of environmental degradation and economic growth. Further it is also 
important to analyse whether social and economic inequalities also have an impact on environmental 
degradation.

This is exactly what we aim to do in our project. We aim to first test the impact of aggregate output and 
SDP on level of groundwater and then see how inequalities tend to impact the quality of the 
environment.
